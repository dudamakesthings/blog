#### This is my project for my Yogini Path and a healthy life 🧘‍♀️

I really like yoga, my first contact was with the postures(asanas) that I started in 2018 at a free class in the university that I used to do.

It was really nice and I really loved the experience. Next, I used sometimes YouTube videos from Pri Leite and Yoga Mudra, two Brazilian channels but never did so often. I started to read more about yoga.

In 2019 I participated in a Yoga Massage weekend workshop, there I saw that I liked the philosophy of yoga but that my body was not so flexible and that my mind was too attached to the appearance of my physical body.

At the beginning of 2022, I spent some months with consistency, following the tutorial videos on the YouTube channels. It was really good for my mind, and I got a little bit more confident with my physical body. But in the end, it was not the consistency I would like to have. 

In July 2023, I started a 500h Yoga Instructor Course, but I did 1 week and didn't feel good enough, in mind and body.

I know that yoga is a life philosophy, not just the postures, but for me, it represents so much more, I put so many expectations on it, that I think that I sabotage myself.

I have the desire **until the end of 2024** to become a certified Yoga Instructor.

I will try to share my journey on my Instagram [@dudamakesthings](https://www.instagram.com/dudamakesthings/) and try to keep the project updated here as well.
