**Electric Sheep Crafts** is a brand created in February 2023 for showing to the world my work and selling it, but it represents more than just money for me.

Sadly since I made it 1 year ago it is still an empty page.

Basically is a Instagram page, [click here to see it](https://www.instagram.com/electricsheepcrafts/) and a logo that I created and execute myself. 

The name was inspired in the book of Philip K. Dick ["Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36402034-do-androids-dream-of-electric-sheep), because the Sheep in the book represents the necessity of the character to be seen and feel like part of society. And the book is a great reflection on what makes us part of society and why we crave so much from the other's acceptance. 

_So, why?_ For me this little space, this little brand, represents a way to be part of society too- a way to make me feel better and useful. To share my work and make myself proud that someone wanted to have a little piece of my energy in their house. The Electric Sheep gives Electric Yarn, and this chaotic/electric energy represents my anxiety. The act of making handmade crafts helps with my mental health, an example of mindfulness with crafts. 

Furthermore, the acronym of the brand is ESC, and it represents another thing in my life, the Software Engineer that I want to turn into. ESC is a keyboard key, that represents, escape, exit, or stop and I want to stop the feeling that I don't belong nowhere. My ESC helps to go out of the chaotic state of mind as I said before.

If I could make my handmade crafts making someone happy and my mind less chaotic is what wish for this brand. But I still need to get better with the social anxiety that entrepreneurship brings, and trying to slowly show my work.
