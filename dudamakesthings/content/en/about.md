Hello and Welcome!

My name is **Eduarda** but you can call me **Duda**.

I'm a Brazilian woman in the 30's living in the Netherlands. 

I love to do handmade things, like crochet and knitting.

In this space, I'm planning to post some projects, write about my opinion about books, and movies and write about my learning experiences.

#### Why Duda Makes Things? 

Well, because I have a lot of hobbies and I love to learn, so, I have done and I do so many different things.
