Hello and Welcome!

My name is **Eduarda** but you can call me **Duda**.

I'm a Brazilian woman in the 30's living in the Netherlands. 

I love to do handmade things, like crochet and knitting. Actually I am in love with knitting.

I am planing to post some projects here and my instagram page.

#### Why Duda Makes Things? 

Well, because I have a lot o hobbies and I love to learn, so, I made so things.
